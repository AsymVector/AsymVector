### ðŸš€ Learning & Exploring

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm just getting started on my coding journey, currently around my **10th hour** of actively learning how to code and use Git. This profile is my personal space to learn, experiment, and grow as a developer.

---

## ðŸŒ± **What I'm Currently Learning**

* **Git & GitHub Basics:** Getting comfortable with commands like `clone`, `add`, `commit`, and `push`. Trying to understand how version control helps!
* **[First Programming Language, e.g., Python]:** Focusing on the fundamentals like variables, loops, and functions.
* **[Another Skill/Area of Interest, e.g., Markdown]:** Learning how to format text beautifully for documentation.

---

## âœ¨ **My Goals**

* **Understand Git better:** My aim is to become more confident with version control.
* **Build small projects:** Start creating simple programs or scripts to apply what I learn.
* **Connect and learn from others:** I'm open to advice and seeing how other people build things!
* **Keep exploring new technologies!**
